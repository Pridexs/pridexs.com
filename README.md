# pridexs.com
This is the repository for my main website: [pridexs.com](https://pridexs.com)  

# Description
This website was developed/tested using:
1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a web framework built in Python
2. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the front end (I dislike front-end way too much to build a responsive website by myself)  
3. [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) to handle the requests
4. [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) to connect NGINX and Django

# Motivation
This website is pretty simple, it has only a few screens with not much data being handled in the back end, but, I am trying to run away from PHP and decided that building a simple website in Django would help me get the basics right and understand how everything worked, before going into something going more complex.

# Notes
production.py in pridexs/settings/ is not available as it holds private keys used by the server.
